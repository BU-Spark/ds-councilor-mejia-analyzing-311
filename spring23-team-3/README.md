311 Project
At-Large City Councillor Julia Mejia seeks to understand the cityâ€™s response to 311 service requests and if they are resolving them in an equitable manner. You will use 311 data to understand which communities feel empowered in Boston to demand services and how the city responds to empowered residents across the city. This project is important as it helps the councilor understand if the 311 call requests are addressed in an efficient manner. This is important as for smooth and effective functioning it is important that calls are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner. This also allows us to understand which communities feel empowered to use the 311 call service. 
The files are on branches. Each are labeled accordingly. The code is on jupyter notebooks.
