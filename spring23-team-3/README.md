<h3> Objective </h3>

> At-Large City Councillor Julia Mejia seeks to understand the cityâ€™s response to 311 service requests and if they are resolving them in an equitable manner. This project will use 311 data to understand which communities feel empowered in Boston to demand services and how the city responds to empowered residents across the city.

> This project is important as it helps the councilor understand if the 311 call requests are addressed in an efficient manner. This is important as for smooth and effective functioning it is important that calls are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner. This also allows us to understand which communities feel empowered to use the 311 call service. 
  
<h3> Methodology and code navigation </h3>  
  
> Our team has analyzed the data by concatenating and merging different datasets and creating visualizations from them. We looked into how different parts of Boston are being served by the 311 call service. From cleaning and organizing the data into different charts, we have been able to find patterns that can help the City Councillor to understand and better resolve 311 call requests. The files are on branches.

The visualizations mentioned in the final report can be achieved by running the following google colab notebooks in the code repository.

* deli1.ipynb and chkpa.ipynb contains all the analysis on zipcode level.
* chkpb.ipynb has analysis on reasons and BlockId level.
* utility.ipynb contains some utility functions. 
* deli2.ipynb and deli3.ipynb contains analysis on BlockId Level.
* Extension Folder contains all the work done for the extension analysis i.e LEP vs 311 Requests.
* There are many ipynb files which are the intermediate versions of the files mentioned above , so for the purpose of clarity we avoided including them.

You can also navigate and find the code precisely with supporting csv files in the following google drive link.
