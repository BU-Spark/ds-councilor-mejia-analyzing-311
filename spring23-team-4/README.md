## Project Description

311 is a telephone number that connects people with service representatives who are always ready to provide non-emergency city services and information. Our project aims to understand the cityâ€™s response to 311 service requests by analyzing 311 data. By doing this, we are able to understand which communities feel empowered to demand services and how the city responds. Specifically, we collected and pre-processed the data from CLIMATE READY BOSTON SOCIAL VULNERABILITY dataset and the 311 requests from th past 8 years. We then normalized the data to ensure all variables have fair impacts to the result.

## Navigation

We have different folders in this repository that summarizes our work.

*  Weekly SCRUM Reports 
    * Weekly SCRUM reports in this repository document the progress made by the team in each sprint, including the tasks completed, the challenges encountered, and the goals for the next sprint. 
   
* Deliverables 
    * The deliverable folder is organized according to the different stages of the project, such as data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and testing. Each folder contains code, documentation, and other files relevant to that stage of the project.
    * Additionally, to get a feel of what we did the entire semester, our final report in this folder says it all!

* Data
    * This folder contains every dataset that we used in this project. They could also be found on https://data.boston.gov/dataset.
