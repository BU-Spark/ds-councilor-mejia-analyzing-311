## Project Goal:
The project goal for "Analyzing 311 Responses" is to investigate the city of Boston's response to 311 service requests and assess whether they are being resolved equitably across different communities. By analyzing patterns between the demographics of communities, civic empowerment, and the city's responsiveness to these requests, we aim to identify potential disparities in the allocation of city services. This analysis will provide valuable insights to inform future policy decisions and promote a more equitable distribution of resources and services across all communities in Boston.

## Questions we answered:
Establish majority racial and ethnic composition of each 311 request based on block
group demographics

Which communities are most empowered based on 311 service requests?
